# NSEData

NSE Data pulled in from Quandl repository and rendered in a tabular format. Made use of jQuery DataTables.

Public API link: https://www.quandl.com/data/NSE?keyword=india

# TODO

* The API does not send over the entire data in a single request. Need to deal with how to send 20 request to get the whole dataset.

* Run with node.js
