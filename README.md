# NSEData

NSE Data pulled in from Quandl repository and rendered in a tabular format. Made use of jQuery Datatables.

Public API link: https://www.quandl.com/data/NSE?keyword=india

# TODO

* The API does not send in the entire data in a single request. Need to deal with how to send 20 request to get the whole dataset.

* Add some filtering

* Run with node.js
